Thanks to everyone I got information from and that I forgot to credit. If someone feels left out just write me and IÂ´ll add the credit.

Thanks to all developers and users that share their knowledge and provide so much (free) high quality software that is used in many of these scripts. This would not be possible without all of their efforts.

Last but not least thanks to Apple for developing an extraordinary operating system in macOS.
